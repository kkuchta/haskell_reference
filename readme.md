The last time I went traveling I attempted to catch up on my Haskell learning, which I had put aside a couple months before.  I quickly realized that I didn't remember much basic syntax, although it came back to me pretty quickly as I read through my *Learn You A Haskell* book.  So, I spent some of that trip building reference.hs.  It was a compendium of examples and snippets to remind me how things worked, and it was glorious.

Of course, I didn't put it in version control and now that file is lost to the ages.

So, I'm rebuilding it here.  Maybe someday I'll restore it in its entirety, but for now I'm just adding stuff as I go, so it'll be a bit patchy for a while.
